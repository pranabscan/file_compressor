# file_compressor
It is a basic file compressor app which compress and decompress the the text file size, It was the implementation of Huffman coding technique
it is not effecient then the compressior used this days!!
here we use huffman encoding to compress the text file 
and huffman decoding to decompress or get the original file

This project supports two functions:
1) Encode: Compresses input file passed.
2) Decode: Decompresses Huffman coded file passed back to its original file.
To run this project you need to create an executable file.
Note : it is a text file compressor
